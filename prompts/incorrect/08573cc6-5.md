Analyzing vertical lines
I’m noting the placement of vertical lines around the pivot, spaced irregularly and aligned with specific setbacks. This highlights a unique pattern compared to previous pairs.
Tracing the pattern
OK, let me see. I’m mapping the lines as L-shaped paths from the top-left corners to the pivot, forming a spiral around the pivot, and noting the progression in complexity across pairs.
Spotting patterns
I’m identifying the pivot cell with ‘1’ and the two colors from the top row to form alternating horizontal and vertical lines around the pivot. This creates a sequence of rectangles or partial rectangles.

Assessing grid patterns
Maximizing fitting lines around the pivot, I’m evaluating horizontal and vertical alignments to ensure optimal grid use, aiming to balance both effectively.
Assessing grid dynamics
I’m figuring out the grid size influence on line placement. Larger grids allow more lines with increments of 2, 4, 3, and 5, forming a balanced, maze-like pattern.
Laying out the grid
I’m planning the 13x13 grid with the pivot at (5,6), sketching horizontal and vertical line patterns, and extending the spacing method to fit more lines in the available space.
Ensuring consistent spacing
I’m noting the importance of maintaining uniform increments around the pivot in the 13x13 grid, consistent with previous patterns, to achieve a balanced, symmetrical arrangement.
Enhancing the pattern
I’m adding another step to the 13x13 grid strategy, aligning with previous patterns by ensuring uniform increments of horizontal and vertical lines for symmetry.
Analyzing grid size patterns
Interestingly enough, grid size influences line counts: smaller grids (<12x12) typically have one line each way, with paired lines at the pivot row.
Maximizing grid utilization
I’m examining how the complexity of the grid, particularly the difference between the pivot and edges, affects the number and direction of lines drawn around the pivot.
Mapping grid patterns
I’m analyzing how a 13x13 grid with a pivot at (5,6) utilizes up increment lines at 2 and 4, and down increment lines at 3, 5, and 7, adding a more complex layer.

I’m looking into the stability of vertical lines, consistently using increments of 2 and 4 symmetrically around the pivot. This pattern holds across different grid sizes, except for the absence of a 6 increment.
Maintaining vertical line structure
Vertical lines consistently use 2 and 4 increments symmetrically around the pivot, stopping at 4. Adjustments are made for available space.
Establishing vertical symmetry
I’m observing that vertical lines consistently use 2 and 4 increments symmetrically around the pivot, adjusting for available space.
Identifying vertical line patterns
Taking a closer look, vertical lines emerge at columns 2, 4 (left) and 8, 10 (right), while the pivot cell is substituted by ‘1’.
Mapping the grid
I’m thinking through how lines form closed rectangles around the pivot, using alternating colors for horizontal and vertical lines, with ‘1’ at the pivot cell and lines continuing on either side.
Piecing together the grid
I’m mapping out the grid to confirm that horizontal and vertical lines form a complete grid of rectangles, filling all the cells between these boundaries, with ‘1’ at the pivot cell.
Mapping the grid
I’m clarifying that pair1’s pivot isn’t in a full grid of rectangles. It disrupts the complete grid pattern, showing unexpected subdivisions within the rectangle.
Analyzing the structure
Pair1’s pattern isn’t a complete grid; it forms a stepped structure around the pivot (6,6). This complexity sets it apart from simpler grid patterns observed in pairs0 and 2.
Tracking symmetrical expansions
Pair2 reveals a complex pattern around the pivot, employing horizontal and vertical increments of 2, 3, 4, and 5 to create a detailed structure. Observations show a cutting pattern from left to right.
Mapping out nested L-shapes
Pair2 reveals a pattern of L-shapes within L-shapes, each decreasing in size, with the pivot at the center. This arrangement creates a complex and intricate design.

I’m aligning horizontal lines of color 2 and vertical lines of color 8 to form a spiral around the pivot (5,6) in pair3, beginning from row2 or row3 and expanding outward.
Adjusting and substituting
I’m tweaking patterns from pair2, swapping colors, adjusting for pivot and grid size, and making replacements to align with pair3’s colors.
Piecing together the pattern
I’m analyzing a spiraled layer of L-shapes, adjusting for colors and pivot, and incrementing complexity, aiming for 9 instructions akin to pair0.

Placing the large vertical line at col11, ensuring consistency with previous patterns. This follows the consistent increment pattern and completes the grid layout.
Starting with row3
I’m compensating for the grid’s uniqueness by opting for a larger row and precise increments, ensuring a balanced, incremental pattern around the pivot.
Driving the pattern
Consistently choosing the top row 4 above the pivot ensures an incremental symmetry around the pivot. This method maintains a balanced pattern in the grid.

Piecing together the grid, aiming to reveal hidden L-shaped patterns around the pivot. The hidden grid shape is alphabetic initially, but shifts to numeric based on observed clues.
Inverting colors around the pivot
OK, let me see. I started with colors 2 and 8, figured out symmetrical lines, then swapped to shades 5 and 3. Finally, the grid revealed a distinct L-shape pattern.
Plotting the course
I’m curious about this puzzle. By staying 2 squares away horizontally and vertically from the pivot with different colors, it’s like a multi-color GPS grid.

I’m working through symmetrical line patterns around a pivot, akin to a GPS grid. This resembles pair2, considering the 12x12 and 13x13 dimensions’ closeness.
Tracing L-shapes
I’m mapping out L-shaped sequences forming enclosed areas around the pivot, akin to a maze. These patterns lead me to the final numeric array.
Translating coordinates
I’m thinking through the coordinates from pair2 to align with the pivot in pair3, considering a slight shift for horizontal and vertical lines, and planning the L-shaped pattern.
Shifting coordinates
I’m mapping the vertical lines to align with the pivot by adjusting the row and column indices, ensuring the slice window inclusivity or exclusivity is considered.


Below is one plausible solution derived by closely examining the given input-output pairs and identifying the pattern. Each provided pair transforms a small set of input clues into a layered pattern of horizontal and vertical lines around a pivot cell (the cell containing 1). The first two non-zero cells in the input’s top row determine the “horizontal line color” and “vertical line color.” The pivot cell (1) stays in the same position from input to output, and around it, a complex pattern of nested “L”-shaped paths or rectangles is formed using horizontal lines of the first color and vertical lines of the second color. The examples given (pairs 0 to 2) show increasingly complex patterns, culminating in pair 2, which creates a layered spiral of lines.

For pair 3:

Input 3:
	•	Horizontal line color = input3[0,0] = 2
	•	Vertical line color = input3[0,1] = 8
	•	Pivot at input3[5,6] = 1 (so output3[5,6] = 1)

We will follow a similar pattern to pair 2 (which formed a spiral of alternating horizontal and vertical segments) and apply a consistent transformation adjusted to the new pivot and colors. By observing pair 2, we see a pattern of 9 drawn segments forming nested L-shapes around the pivot. Pair 3’s pivot is shifted one row up and one column to the right relative to pair 2’s pivot, so we shift all lines accordingly and change the colors to 2 (horizontal) and 8 (vertical).

Final Output 3 Construction:

Start with a zeroed 13x13 output. Then apply:
	1.	Large outer L-shape:
	•	Horizontal line near the top:

output3[1,1:10] = 2

(Row 1, columns 1 through 9 set to 2)

	•	Vertical line on the right side:

output3[1:10,10] = 8

(Column 10, rows 1 through 9 set to 8)

	2.	Next inner L-shape:
	•	Horizontal line:

output3[3,2:8] = 2

(Row 3, columns 2 through 7 set to 2)

	•	Vertical line:

output3[3:8,8] = 8

(Column 8, rows 3 through 7 set to 8)

	3.	Another vertical line on the left:

output3[4:11,2] = 8

(Column 2, rows 4 through 10 set to 8)

	4.	Small horizontal line near the pivot row:

output3[5,4:6] = 2

(Row 5, columns 4 and 5 set to 2)
Place the pivot:

output3[5,6] = 1


	5.	Another vertical line inside:

output3[6:9,4] = 8

(Column 4, rows 6 through 8 set to 8)

	6.	Another horizontal line lower down:

output3[8,5:9] = 2

(Row 8, columns 5 through 8 set to 2)

	7.	Bottom horizontal line:

output3[10,3:11] = 2

(Row 10, columns 3 through 10 set to 2)

All unspecified cells remain 0.

Thus, output3 should be:
	•	A 13x13 array of zeros.
	•	With the lines as defined above drawn in colors 2 (horizontal segments) and 8 (vertical segments).
	•	The pivot cell at (5,6) set to 1.

No other cells are modified.

Final Answer:

Below is a textual representation (0-based indexing) showing non-zero cells. “…” represents zeros omitted for brevity. The coordinates are (row, column).

Row 0: all 0
Row 1: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 0 0
Row 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
Row 3: 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 0 0 0 0
Row 4: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
Row 5: 0 8 0 0 2 2 1 0 8 0 0 0 0
Row 6: 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
Row 7: 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
Row 8: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 8 0 0 0 0
Row 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Row 10:0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0
Row 11:all 0
Row 12:all 0

(Adjusting exact zeros around lines as per defined slices.)

This matches the pattern of spiraling L-shapes derived from pair2, but shifted and recolored for pair3.

Conclusion: It doesn't make the spiral correctly. Leans too much to the left.
