Just populate the `output3` with the correct values.

Okay, let's analyze the pattern and then generate `output3`.

**Pattern Analysis**

The core idea seems to be to take the elements in the top row of the input and make them into lines at different offsets, with the first value forming a top line, a right line, and a "cross-like" shape, while the other values move more towards the bottom as a "cross-like" pattern of lines and intersections, with the additional unique input value becoming part of one of the created lines. It seems that the first two input values dictate the position and orientation of the lines while the remaining input values are mapped directly, unchanged, into the output. 

Here's a breakdown by pairs, noticing how they use a base for their lines and then work their way to the bottom with different lengths:

*   **Pair 0:**
    *   `input0[0,0] = 5` becomes the line `output0[2, 0:5]` and a vertical segment `output0[4, 1:3]` and `output0[7, 2:6]`
    *   `input0[0,1] = 6` becomes the line `output0[2:7,5]` and two vertical segments: `output0[5:8,1]`
    *   `input0[4,3] = 1` is unchanged.
*   **Pair 1:**
    *   `input1[0,0] = 3` becomes the line `output1[4, 2:8]` and segments: `output1[6, 4:6]` and `output1[9, 5:9]`
    *   `input1[0,1] = 2` becomes the line `output1[4:9,8]` and segments `output1[5:11,2]` and `output1[7:10,4]`
    *   `input1[6,6] = 1` is unchanged.
*   **Pair 2:**
    *   `input2[0,0] = 5` becomes the line `output2[2, 0:9]` and segments `output2[4, 1:7]` and `output2[6,3:5]` and `output2[9,4:8]` and `output2[11, 2:10]`
    *   `input2[0,1] = 3` becomes the line `output2[2:11, 9]` and segments `output2[4:9,7]` and `output2[5:12,1]` and `output2[7:10,3]`
    *   `input2[6,5] = 1` is unchanged

*   **Generalization:** The first value from the first row appears as a cross-like series of horizontal lines with varying lengths. The second value from the first row appears as a cross-like series of vertical lines with varying lengths. The remaining value appears unchanged

The horizontal lines start at `row = 2` (which is a constant). The vertical lines start at `row = 2 + 2`. It seems that the lines extend to the same distance as the row-size of the image (starting from row = 2), but never pass row-size. The segments of lines appear using a pattern of 2 and 3 rows distance from each other.

**Applying the Pattern to Pair 3**

Let's apply this logic to `input3`:

*   `input3[0,0] = 2`
*   `input3[0,1] = 8`
*   `input3[5,6] = 1`

Based on this, the logic that we have found, and the size of the image (13x13), we will populate the `output3` variable as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

input3=np.zeros((13,13),dtype=np.uint8)
input3[0,0]=2
input3[0,1]=8
input3[5,6]=1
output3=np.zeros((13,13),dtype=np.uint8)
output3[2,0:11]=2
output3[2:13,11]=8
output3[4,1:9]=2
output3[4:11,9]=8
output3[5:13,1]=8
output3[6,3:7]=2
output3[6,6]=1
output3[7:10,3]=8
output3[9,4:10]=2
output3[11,2:11]=2
```

Conclusion: Makes a mistake in the start of the spiral, with a 3px long red line next to the blue center pixel. The red line should have been 2px.
