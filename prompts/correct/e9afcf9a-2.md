# ARC Puzzle

```json
{"train":[{"input":[[3,3,3,3,3,3],[9,9,9,9,9,9]],"output":[[3,9,3,9,3,9],[9,3,9,3,9,3]]},{"input":[[4,4,4,4,4,4],[8,8,8,8,8,8]],"output":[[4,8,4,8,4,8],[8,4,8,4,8,4]]}],"test":[{"input":[[6,6,6,6,6,6],[2,2,2,2,2,2]]}]}
```

The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
**Task A**

After analyzing the input/output pairs:

* All inputs have a common pattern: two arrays of six elements each, where each element is either 3 and 9 (train) or 4 and 8 (train), or 6 and 2 (test).
* All outputs have a common pattern: two arrays of six elements each, where each element is the same as the corresponding input element, but in an alternating pattern.
* The inputs and outputs share a common structure: two arrays of six elements each.

**Transformation**

The transformation from input to output appears to be an alternating pattern swap. Specifically:

* For each pair of adjacent elements in the input array, swap them in the output array.

**Verification**

Let's verify that this transformation rule works on all input/output pairs:

1. Train 1:
	* Input: [[3,3,3,3,3,3],[9,9,9,9,9,9]]
	* Output: [[3,9,3,9,3,9],[9,3,9,3,9,3]]
	* Transformation rule works: swapping adjacent elements in the input array produces the output array.
2. Train 2:
	* Input: [[4,4,4,4,4,4],[8,8,8,8,8,8]]
	* Output: [[4,8,4,8,4,8],[8,4,8,4,8,4]]
	* Transformation rule works: swapping adjacent elements in the input array produces the output array.
3. Test:
	* Input: [[6,6,6,6,6,6],[2,2,2,2,2,2]]
	* Output: ? (to be determined)
	* Transformation rule should work: swapping adjacent elements in the input array should produce the output array.

**Task B**

Based on the transformation rule and verification, I will solve the ARC puzzle:

The test output is:
```json
[[6,2,6,2,6,2],[2,6,2,6,2,6]]
```
This output follows the same alternating pattern swap as the train outputs.

**Task C**

The `test.output` data in JSON format is:
```json
[[6,2,6,2,6,2],[2,6,2,6,2,6]]
```
