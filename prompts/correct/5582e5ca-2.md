SYSTEM PROMPT:
You solve ARC puzzles by carefully examining patterns in each example. Identify the rules, verify them on all examples, then solve the test input

---

PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
Output:
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4

Example 2:

Input:
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
Output:
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9

Example 3:

Input:
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
Output:
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
8 8 6
4 6 9
8 3 0


---

RESPONSE:
After examining the examples, I noticed that in each case, the output grid consists of a single number repeated across all cells.

In Example 1, the input grid has values 4, 4, and 8. The output grid has values 4 repeated three times. In Example 2, the input grid has values 6, 8, and 9. The output grid has values 9 repeated three times. Similarly, in Example 3, the input grid has values 4, 6, and 9. The output grid has values 6 repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, I predict that the corresponding output grid for the test input grid is:

Output:
8 8 8
8 8 8
8 8 8

response byte count: 577
response item count: 159
elapsed: 4.84 seconds

expected output:
[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]

predicted output:
[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]

status: correct
