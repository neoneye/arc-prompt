# ARC Puzzle

```json
{"train":[{"input":[[6,6,7,6],[6,6,7,7],[7,7,6,7]],"output":[[2,2,7,2],[2,2,7,7],[7,7,2,7]]},{"input":[[7,7,7,6],[6,6,7,6],[7,7,6,7],[7,6,7,7],[7,6,7,6],[6,6,6,7]],"output":[[7,7,7,2],[2,2,7,2],[7,7,2,7],[7,2,7,7],[7,2,7,2],[2,2,2,7]]},{"input":[[7,7,6,6,6,6],[6,7,6,7,7,7],[7,6,7,7,6,7]],"output":[[7,7,2,2,2,2],[2,7,2,7,7,7],[7,2,7,7,2,7]]}],"test":[{"input":[[6,7,7,6],[6,7,6,7],[7,7,7,6],[7,6,7,6]]}]}
```

The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
### Task A: Identifying Patterns and Transformation Rules

#### Commonalities in Inputs:
- All inputs are 2D arrays of integers.
- The integers range from 6 to 7.

#### Commonalities in Outputs:
- All outputs are also 2D arrays of integers.
- The integers range from 2 to 7.

#### Input/Output Relationship:
- Each input array seems to have a transformation applied where some values change, while others remain the same.
- Specifically, the value `6` is being replaced with `2`, and the value `7` remains unchanged.

### Task B: Solving the Puzzle

Given the identified pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test input:

**Test Input:**
```json
[[6,7,7,6],[6,7,6,7],[7,7,7,6],[7,6,7,6]]
```

Applying the transformation:
- Replace `6` with `2`.
- Keep `7` unchanged.

**Test Output:**
```json
[[2,7,7,2],[2,7,2,7],[7,7,7,2],[7,2,7,2]]
```

### Task C: Converting the Test Output to JSON Format

The test output is already in JSON format. Here it is again for clarity:

```json
[[2,7,7,2],[2,7,2,7],[7,7,7,2],[7,2,7,2]]
```
