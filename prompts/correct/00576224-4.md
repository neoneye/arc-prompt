SYSTEM PROMPT:
You solve ARC puzzles by carefully examining patterns in each example. Identify the rules, verify them on all examples, then solve the test input

---

PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
8 6
6 4
Output:
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4
6 8 6 8 6 8
4 6 4 6 4 6
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4

Example 2:

Input:
7 9
4 3
Output:
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3
9 7 9 7 9 7
3 4 3 4 3 4
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
3 2
7 8


---

RESPONSE:
After examining the examples, I noticed that the output grid is created by repeating the rows of the input grid in a specific pattern.

In Example 1:

* The first row (8 6) is repeated three times.
* The second row (6 4) is repeated three times.
* Then, the two rows are swapped and repeated again.

Similarly, in Example 2:

* The first row (7 9) is repeated three times.
* The second row (4 3) is repeated three times.
* Then, the two rows are swapped and repeated again.

Applying this pattern to the test input grid:

Input:
3 2
7 8

The output grid would be:

3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8
2 3 2 3 2 3
8 7 8 7 8 7
3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8

So, the predicted output grid is:

3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8
2 3 2 3 2 3
8 7 8 7 8 7
3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8

response byte count: 744
response item count: 296
elapsed: 10.04 seconds

expected output:
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]

predicted output:
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]

status: correct
