PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
Output:
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3

Example 2:

Input:
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
Output:
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
6 6 6 6 6 6
2 2 2 2 2 2


---

RESPONSE:
Based on the examples provided, I notice that in each case, the input grid consists of two rows with identical elements. The output grid also has two rows, but with a specific pattern: the first row is identical to the first row of the input grid, and the second row is identical to the second row of the input grid, but with the positions of the elements swapped.

Applying this rule to the test input grid:

Input:
6 6 6 6 6 6
2 2 2 2 2 2

The output grid would be:

Output:
6 2 6 2 6 2
2 6 2 6 2 6

response byte count: 500
response item count: 144
elapsed: 4.45 seconds

expected output:
[[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2], [2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]

predicted output:
[[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2], [2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]

status: correct
