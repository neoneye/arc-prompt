# ARC Puzzle

```json
{"train":[{"input":[[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]],"output":[[1]]},{"input":[[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,2,0]],"output":[[7]]},{"input":[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]],"output":[[1]]},{"input":[[0,0,0],[2,0,2],[0,0,0]],"output":[[1]]},{"input":[[2,2,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,0]],"output":[[7]]},{"input":[[2,2,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]],"output":[[7]]}],"test":[{"input":[[2,0,2],[2,2,2],[2,0,2]]}]}
```

The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
### Task A: Analysis

**Inputs:**
- All inputs are 3x3 matrices.
- The numbers in the matrices are either 0 or 2.

**Outputs:**
- All outputs are single-element arrays containing a number (either 1 or 7).

**Input/Output Relationship:**
- The transformation seems to be based on the presence of the number 2 in the input matrix.
- If there is at least one 2 in the matrix, the output is [1].
- If there are no 2s in the matrix, the output is [7].

### Task B: Solving the Puzzle

Given the pattern identified:
- The test input is `[[2,0,2],[2,2,2],[2,0,2]]`.
- This matrix contains multiple 2s.

According to the transformation rule:
- Since there are 2s in the matrix, the output should be [1].

### Task C: JSON Format for Test Output

```json
[[1]]
```
