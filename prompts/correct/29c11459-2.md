# ARC Puzzle

```json
{"train":[{"input":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"output":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]},{"input":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"output":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[3,3,3,3,3,5,7,7,7,7,7],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]}],"test":[{"input":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]]}]}
```

The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
**Task A**

After analyzing the input and output data:

* All inputs have a 2D array structure with 5 rows and 11 columns.
* All outputs have a 2D array structure with 5 rows and 11 columns.
* The input and output arrays have a one-to-one correspondence, meaning each element in the input array corresponds to an element in the output array.

**Transformation**

The transformation from input to output appears to be a simple replacement of values:

* Input value `0` is replaced by output value `0`.
* Input value `1` is replaced by output value `1`.
* Input value `2` is replaced by output value `5`, and the next two elements are also set to `2`.
* Input value `3` is replaced by output value `3`, and the next four elements are also set to `3`.
* Input value `4` is replaced by output value `6`.
* Input value `5` is replaced by output value `5`.
* Input value `6` is replaced by output value `9`.
* Input value `7` is replaced by output value `7`, and the next four elements are also set to `7`.
* Input value `8` is replaced by output value `8`.

**Task B**

Based on the transformation rules, I will solve the ARC puzzle:

```json
{"test":{"input":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]],"output":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[4,4,4,4,4,5,8,8,8,8,8],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,6,6,6,6,5,9,9,9,9,9]]}}
```

**Task C**

The `test.output` data in JSON format is:

```json
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[4,4,4,4,4,5,8,8,8,8,8],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[6,6,6,6,6,5,9,9,9,9,9]]
```
