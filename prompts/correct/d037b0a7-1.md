SYSTEM PROMPT:
You solve ARC puzzles by carefully examining patterns in each example. Identify the rules, verify them on all examples, then solve the test input

---

PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
Output:
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6

Example 2:

Input:
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
Output:
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8

Example 3:

Input:
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
Output:
4 0 0
4 2 0
4 2 0

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
4 0 8
0 0 0
0 7 0


---

RESPONSE:
After examining the examples, I notice that in each case, the output grid is identical to the input grid except for one column where a value from another row is copied. Specifically:

* In Example 1, the value "4" (from the first row) is not changed, but the value "0" (in the second row) becomes "6", which is actually the value in the third row.
* In Example 2, the value "7" (in the second row) is copied to the first row, and the value "8" (in the third row) is also copied to the first row.
* In Example 3, the value "4" (in the first row) is copied to the second row.

Based on this observation, I'm going to take a guess that the rule is: "Copy the maximum value from another row into the current row".

If we apply this rule to the test input grid:

Input:
4 0 8
0 0 0
0 7 0

The output grid would be:

Output:
4 0 8 (no change)
4 0 8 (copy "8" from third row into second row)
4 7 8 (copy "7" from third row into first row)

So, the predicted output grid is:

4 0 8
4 0 8
4 7 8

response byte count: 985
response item count: 289
elapsed: 8.70 seconds

expected output:
[[4, 0, 8], [4, 0, 8], [4, 7, 8]]

predicted output:
[[4, 0, 8], [4, 0, 8], [4, 7, 8]]

status: correct
