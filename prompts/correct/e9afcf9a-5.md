SYSTEM PROMPT:
You solve ARC puzzles by carefully examining patterns in each example. Identify the rules, verify them on all examples, then solve the test input

---

PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
Output:
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3

Example 2:

Input:
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
Output:
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
6 6 6 6 6 6
2 2 2 2 2 2

RESPONSE:
Let's analyze the examples to find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid.

In both Example 1 and Example 2, we can see that:

* The first row of the output grid is created by alternating between the first element of the input grid (3 or 4) and the second element of the input grid (9 or 8).
* The second row of the output grid is created by alternating between the second element of the input grid (9 or 8) and the first element of the input grid (3 or 4).

This suggests that the rule is to alternate between two elements in each row, starting with the first element.

Applying this rule to the test input grid:

Input:
6 6 6 6 6 6
2 2 2 2 2 2

The output grid would be:

Output:
6 2 6 2 6 2
2 6 2 6 2 6
