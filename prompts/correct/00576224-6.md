SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an ARC solver. Figure out whats wrong with the 'maybe output'. Then explain your reasoning and provide your own final answer. The answer must be different than the 'maybe output'.

PROMPT:
Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.

Example 1:

Input:
8 6
6 4
Output:
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4
6 8 6 8 6 8
4 6 4 6 4 6
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4

Example 2:

Input:
7 9
4 3
Output:
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3
9 7 9 7 9 7
3 4 3 4 3 4
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3

Below is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Your final answer should just be the text output grid itself.

Input:
3 2
7 8
Maybe output:
3 7 2 3
7 8 7 8
3 2 3 2

RESPONSE:
The common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid is that the output grid is created by alternating the rows of the input grid.

In the given examples, the input grid has two rows. The output grid is created by alternating these two rows. For example, in the first example, the input grid is:

8 6
6 4

The output grid is created by alternating these two rows:

8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4
6 8 6 8 6 8
4 6 4 6 4 6
8 6 8 6 8 6
6 4 6 4 6 4

Similarly, in the second example, the input grid is:

7 9
4 3

The output grid is created by alternating these two rows:

7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3
9 7 9 7 9 7
3 4 3 4 3 4
7 9 7 9 7 9
4 3 4 3 4 3

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:

3 2
7 8

The output grid will be created by alternating these two rows:

3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8
2 3 2 3 2 3
8 7 8 7 8 7
3 2 3 2 3 2
7 8 7 8 7 8

The "maybe output" is incorrect because it does not follow the rule of alternating rows. The correct output grid is the one above.

predicted output:
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]
