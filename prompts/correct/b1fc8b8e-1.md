The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
**Task A**

After analyzing the input and output data, I noticed that:

* All inputs have a 6x6 grid of numbers (0-8) with some cells filled.
* All outputs have a 5x5 grid of numbers (0-8) with some cells filled.
* The commonality between all inputs is that they are all valid Sudoku puzzles in the process of being solved.
* The commonality between all outputs is that they are all partially solved Sudoku puzzles.

**Transformation**

The transformation from input to output appears to be a simple reduction of the grid size by one row and column, while maintaining the same puzzle structure. This suggests that the output is a "simplified" version of the input, where some rows and columns have been removed or condensed.

**Verification**

To verify this hypothesis, I can apply the transformation rules to each input/output pair:

1. Remove the last row from the input grid.
2. Remove the last column from the resulting grid.
3. The output should match the transformed grid.

Applying these rules to each pair, I found that they indeed produce the corresponding outputs. This confirms my hypothesis about the transformation rules.

**Task B**

Now that we have a clear understanding of the transformation rules, let's solve the ARC puzzle:

The input/output pairs suggest that the goal is to transform the 6x6 grid into a 5x5 grid by removing rows and columns. To solve this puzzle, I can try different combinations of row and column removals to see which one produces a valid output.

After some trial and error, I found that the following transformation rules work:

* Remove the last row from each input grid.
* Remove the last column from each resulting grid.

Applying these rules to each input/output pair, I get the corresponding outputs. This confirms that we have correctly solved the ARC puzzle.

**Task C**

Now that we have solved the ARC puzzle, let's convert the `test.output` data to JSON format:

```json
[[8,8,0,8,8],[8,8,0,8,8],[0,0,0,0,0],[8,8,0,8,8],[8,8,0,8,8]]
```
