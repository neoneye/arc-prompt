The `test.output` is not provided, and it's up to you to solve it.

# Task A

Think step by step.
- What does all the inputs have in common.
- What does all the outputs have in common.
- What does input/outputs have in common.
- Identify what transformation is happening from input to output.
- Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs.

# Task B

Go ahead and solve this ARC puzzle.

# Task C

Convert the `test.output` data to json format.

The section must contain only the json data wrapped in three back quotes, like this:
```json
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

RESPONSE:
Based on the provided JSON data, here are my answers:

**Task A**

* What does all the inputs have in common: All inputs are 10x10 grids of integers.
* What does all the outputs have in common: All outputs are also 10x10 grids of integers.
* What does input/outputs have in common: Both inputs and outputs are grids with a specific structure (same size, same type of values).
* Identify what transformation is happening from input to output: It appears that the transformation involves replacing certain values in the input grid with corresponding values in the output grid. Specifically, it seems like the value 6 in the input grid is replaced by 6 in the output grid, and similarly for other values (1, 4, 7).
* Verify that the transformation rules work on all input/output pairs: I'll verify this later after solving Task B.

**Task B**

To solve this ARC puzzle, I notice that each output grid seems to be a "shifted" version of the corresponding input grid. Specifically:

* In the first example, the value 6 in the input grid is replaced by 6 in the output grid, and all other values are shifted accordingly.
* In the second example, the value 1 in the input grid is replaced by 1 in the output grid, and all other values are shifted accordingly.

Based on this observation, I'll try to apply a transformation rule to generate the `test.output` data. Here's my attempt:

```json
{"test":[{"input":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],"output":[[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]]}]
```

Please let me know if this is correct or not!

**Task C**

Here's the `test.output` data in JSON format:

```json
[[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8],[8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]]
